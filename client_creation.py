# refactor wallet code provided by iota
# check if anything more needs to be added to db and update accordingly
# create a function that generates and stores keys for newly made user
# create a function to check inputted password (if it's secure)
# create a function that stores all user info as a record in users table 
# (some info taken straight from this class, some inputted by the user but in case of testing - hardcoded)
